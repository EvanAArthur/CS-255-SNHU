Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was intended to show the proccess behind working with a client and gathering information to create a specific system for them. This project also provided experience in creating documents for the client as well as the development team in order to achieve success. In this case, the clinet was DriverPass and they desired an online system to help facilitate their business operations. The client requested the system provide a way for the customer to schedule driving lessons as well as provide up to date practice test on the topics of driving. 

What did you do particularly well?

I found that I was able to parse out the information provided in the given transcripts of the discussions with the client. I was able to take the non technical information provided and translate it to charts and diagrams that could be better understood by the development team. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I would like to go back and clean up some of the diagrams I made. As I was working with limited information I was required to assume some of the information instead of continuing conversation to get a better understanding of what the client wanted. I also understand that these diagrams are jumping on points that would be further revised and edited in a real world situation too though that is not to say I put half effort into them. Further more, I am working with a free LucidChart account which creates limitations in my diagrams. The gantt chart for example does not look nearly as clean as it should based on these limitations of a free account. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Sometimes the user knows what they want but does not always know how to say it. I used the transcripts I was provided and did my best to interpret the non technical language to create the various diagrams. If this was a real world application, I would bring these charts to the client to discuss how I have interepreted what they desire from the system and see what changes need to be made. Was there something they forgot to mention? was there something that I had to rework based on feasability?

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Communication is key to success. Understanding as best as possible the desires of the client and understanding as best as possible the abilities of the design team van make me a fantastic. I would communicate with my team and gather an understanding of peoples strengths and weakness if I was required to delagte roles to people. I would use the most "appropriate" language to achieve the best line of communication and understanding with whoever I am conversing with.
